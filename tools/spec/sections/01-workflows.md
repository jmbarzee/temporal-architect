# Workflow Definitions

```
workflow_def ::= 'workflow' IDENT params ['->' return_type] ':' NEWLINE
                 INDENT
                 [state_block]
                 [signal_decl*]
                 [query_decl*]
                 [update_decl*]
                 statement*
                 DEDENT

params ::= '(' [param_list] ')'
param_list ::= param (',' param)*
param ::= IDENT ':' type
return_type ::= '(' type_list ')'  # Always parenthesized
type_list ::= type (',' type)*
type ::= IDENT | type '[' type ']' | type '{' ... '}'
```

**Important:** The state block (if present) must appear first, followed by signal/query/update declarations, then body statements. Each signal/query/update can only be declared once per workflow.

## State Block

The state block declares workflow state including named conditions and variable initializations. It must appear before signal/query/update declarations:

```
state_block ::= 'state' ':' NEWLINE
                INDENT
                state_stmt*
                DEDENT

state_stmt ::= condition_decl | raw_stmt

condition_decl ::= 'condition' IDENT NEWLINE
```

**Restrictions:** No temporal primitives inside `state:` block. It is purely declarative.

## Signal Declarations

Signal handlers are defined at the beginning of workflows with handler body blocks:

```
signal_decl ::= 'signal' IDENT params ':' NEWLINE
                INDENT
                statement*
                DEDENT
```

Signal handler bodies execute when the signal arrives. Handlers have access to the full workflow statement set (activities, child workflows, timers, etc.).

## Query Declarations

Query handlers are defined at the beginning of workflows with handler body blocks:

```
query_decl ::= 'query' IDENT params '->' return_type ':' NEWLINE
               INDENT
               statement*
               DEDENT
```

**Return type is required for queries** (always parenthesized, e.g., `-> (Status)`).

Query handler bodies are restricted to the activity statement set (no temporal primitives like timers, signals, or child workflows). Queries must not modify workflow state.

## Update Declarations

Update handlers are defined at the beginning of workflows with handler body blocks:

```
update_decl ::= 'update' IDENT params '->' return_type ':' NEWLINE
                INDENT
                statement*
                DEDENT
```

**Return type is required for updates** (always parenthesized, e.g., `-> (Result)`).

Update handler bodies execute when the update is received. Handlers have access to the full workflow statement set and can return values to the caller.
